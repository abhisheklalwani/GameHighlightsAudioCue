# GameHighlightsAudioCue
This repository contains my script for listening to the user audio and recording the last 10 seconds of his/her gameplay based upon an audio cue given by the user (Currently the predefined trigger word is Capture).
It's currently in a very prelimiinary stage and there are quite a few bugs but the POC works as expected.
Will be cleaning up the code sometime in the near future.
